### https://digiteers.github.io/

We are a new social organization whose aim is to utilize IT professionals to help refugee centers operate more efficiently.
 
We provide teams of 3 to 5 IT professionals to volunteer a designated amount of time per every week. We want to be that bridge the IT gap by providing hands-on support, teaching and ongoing IT service.
 
## What we do?
 
Step one is: observation and IT evaluation:
What type of technology is being used? Is there internet at the site?How are volunteers currently communicating and sharing data? Etc.

We are currently looking for a pilot site to begin validating and refining our model.
 
## Who we are?

Moritz, Scott, Tim, Crisi and Ulrike are a diverse group who have a mix of technical, business and IT backgrounds. 
Oliver is from the Berlin Migration Hub http://www.migrationhub.eu/ and also works closely with https://volunteer-planner.org/
 
## Moving Forward.
 
If you are interested please email us back. We are more than happy to schedule a time where we can sit down and provide a more thorough explanation.
